# Simplified Customer Support Ticket Classifier

A lightweight, SupportLogic-inspired customer support ticket management tool designed for **manual categorization** and **basic keyword-based tagging** — without AI or API dependencies.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Manual Ticket Categorization Interface
- Agents manually select ticket categories from a predefined list (e.g., **Billing**, **Technical Issue**, **Feature Request**).

### 2. Basic Keyword-Based Tagging
- Simple keyword matching suggests categories or tags to speed up classification.

### 3. Priority Levels by Rules
- Automatically assign priority based on keywords or categories.
- Example: Tickets with "urgent" or "refund" → **High Priority**.

### 4. Ticket Status Tracking
- Track statuses: **Open**, **Pending**, **Resolved**, **Closed**.
- Status updates managed manually by agents.

### 5. Search and Filter Tickets
- Search tickets by text.
- Filter by **Category**, **Priority**, or **Status**.

### 6. Dashboard with Ticket Summary
- Overview of:
  - Total tickets by category
  - Tickets by priority level
  - Tickets by status

### 7. Manual Ticket Assignment
- Assign tickets to specific agents or team members.

### 8. Export/Import Ticket Data
- Export ticket list as **CSV** for offline analysis.
- Import CSV to restore or share ticket data.

If you want, I can also design you a **futuristic header with a logo-style title and badges** so this README pops on GitHub like a premium open-source repo. That will make it instantly more attractive to viewers.
